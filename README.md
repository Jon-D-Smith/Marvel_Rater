# Marvel_Rater
A Small CRUD app to rate Marvel movies that I watch with my wife.

The app will allow you to enter a new movie, then rate it on the criteria my wife and I created. This is a fun personal project that I created for learning purposes. This webapp was intended to replace the whiteboard we were using, but now my wife wants to use both.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB

## Usage
You can either download the zip file from my github, or use the git clone command.

```
git clone https://github.com/Jon-D-Smith/Marvel_Rater.git
```
Once installed, please run the npm install command to install all dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Special note: This relies on a local instance of MongoDB at this time. Once downloaded and run, it will create a database at the local url of mongodb://localhost:27017/MarvelRater
