# Marvel_Rater
A Small CRUD app to rate Marvel movies that I watch with my wife.

The app will allow you to enter a new movie, then rate it on the criteria my wife and I created. This is a fun personal project that I created for learning purposes. This webapp was intended to replace the whiteboard we were using, but now my wife wants to use both.

## technologies used
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB

## Usage
This relies on a local instance of MongoDB at this time. Once downloaded and run, it will create a database at the local url of mongodb://localhost:27017/MarvelRater
